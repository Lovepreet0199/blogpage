                <img id="first-image" src="images/imigration.PNG" alt="immigration icon">
                <p>In December 2017, at just 18 years old, I left India carrying not just a suitcase, but a heart full
                    of dreams and a mind buzzing with hopes. The moment I stepped off the plane in Toronto, reality hit
                    me - the cold was biting, the streets were unfamiliar, and the world felt bigger than what i had
                    ever imagined. I was alone, yet determined, knowing this journey was my first step towards building
                    a life I could be proud of.</p>
                <p><a href="http://www.Humber.ca">Humber College</a> became more than just a school; it became a lifeline.
                    I learnt drafting, design
                    principles, using AutoCad and Revit, and how to think critically about structures and space. But the
                    real lessons came outside the classroom. Working as a security guard while studying full-time was
                    exhausting. Long nights, early mornings, and endless responsibilities tested me in ways I had never
                    experienced. But each struggle made me stronger, independent, and more resilient.</p>

                 <img id="second-image" src="images/mydroneshot.jpg" alt="droneshot">
                <p>When I graduated in 2020, I expected the doors to open. Instead, the world seemed to close. COVID-19
                    froze the job market, canceled interviews, and left opportunities slipping through my fingers. I
                    remember feeling frustrated, helpless, and doubtful. For the first time since arriving in Canada, I
                    questioned whether I had made the right Choices?</p>
                <p>Yet giving up was never an option. I chose a path I had never imagined - I became a truck driver. For
                    two years, I drove across Canada, from the snowy roads of <a
                        href="https://www.quebec-cite.com/en">Quebec</a>, to the plain roads of <a
                        href="https://www.travelmanitoba.com/places/">Manitoba</a>, to
                    majestic Rockies of <a
                        href="https://www.travelalberta.com/places-to-go/albertas-regions/canadian-rockies">Alberta</a>
                    and finally to the sunrises of <a href="https://www.supernaturalbc.com/">British Columbia</a>.
                    Later, I expanded into cross-border trucking to the United States. The highways became my sanctuary,
                    offering quiet moments
                    to reflect, and to rediscover my inner strength.</p>
                <p>My journey in trucking has taught me many valuable lessons. It's also how I discovered my passion for
                    photography. Along the way, I created countless memories and captured beautiful sunrises and sunsets
                    across Canada and the United States - moments I truly admire.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time on my own, which gave me the space to reflect and understand what I truly want
                    in life. Experiencing different parts of the country made me realize that the world is a vast place
                    filled with kind people. It helped me create both sweet and sour memories that shaped who I am
                    today.</p>
                <p>During this time, one of my proudest moments arrived - becoming a Permanent Resident of Canada. I
                    still remember receiving that email while visiting my family in <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India">Punjab</a> it was overwhelming sense of
                    joy and accomplishment. It was more than legal proof; it was validation of every sacrifice, every
                    sleepless night, and every challenge overcome.</p>

                <h1 class="content-heading">From Driving to Coding</h1>
                 <img id="third-image" src="images/codingimage.jpg" alt="codingimage">
                <p>Even with stability, my heart longed for more. I had always been curious about technology - the way
                    lines of code could bring ideas to life, just as architecture shaped physical space. So I returned
                    to Humber College to study Web Development, daring step into a new world once again.</p>
                <p>Transitioning from driving to Coding was challenging, yet exhilarating. Debugging code reminded me
                    of problem-solving on the road, and designing user interfaces connected back to the precision I
                    learned in the architecture. Every experience - the struggles, the detours, and the triumphs - felt
                    like
                    pieces of a puzzle finally falling into place.</p>
                <p>My journey has never been straight or easy, but it has been mine - shaped by courage, resilience, and
                    determination. From India to Canada, from architecture to trucking, and now to web development - I
                    am proof that reinvention is possible. And today, I continue building my future, one line of code at
                    a time.</p>
